# Archon_CMS
Archon CMS is a custom `Content Management System [CMS]` that is being 
designed for educational purposes.  


This project utilises:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS, 
3) Javascript, 
4) JQuery
5) AJAX
6) MySQL 
7) Prodedural PHP (Only for initial development)
8) Object Oriented PHP [OOP] (After initial Development, Read below)


The Project will be converted to Object Orientated PHP after being written
in Procedural PHP.

The reason being that it will allow me to learn essential PHP concepts, 
techniques, security measures, bad / weak coding practices and how to convert 
procedural websites into OOP based websites.
